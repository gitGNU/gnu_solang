Solang - A photo manager for GNOME
==================================
Website: http://projects.gnome.org/solang

Motivation for the project
--------------------------
The idea is to develop a free photo manager that will act as a front-end for
directory based local storage as well as remote photo-storage systems, as can
be said, on the "Cloud". Basic editing support is also planned as well as a
small pipelaine for RAW processing. Please check the TODO file for more
details.

Another motivation for this project is to break the performance charecteristics
of current popular photo management softwares and provide a fast and reliable
alternative that does not place humongous demands on user's hardware resources
even to meet basic functionality.

Why is it called "Solang"?
--------------------------
While looking for a random name, we noticed the name on one of our office
workstations. It was called "solang" and so we stand here today with this name.

Also, take a look at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solang_valley

Features:
---------
- Browser, enlarged and slideshow renderers for viewing the entire
  collection, editing, a single photo and slideshows respectively.
- Folder exporter to export selected photos to a folder.
- Date view for showing photo dates.
- Basic editing like brightness, contrast, flipping, rotation, saturation and
  scaling, and undo, redo of operations.
- Ability to copy a set of applied operations from one photo and paste it
  onto others.
- Support for tagging photos and Exif data.
- Thumbnails for showing RAW files in the browser renderer.
- Search basket for drag and drop search using multiple tags, Exif fields
  and/or dates.
